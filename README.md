# 📚 Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs and Custom Hashmap Implementation 

🚀 This repository contains all the codes of the project, **"Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs"**

## 📌 Overview
This project uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **vector databases** to build an advanced **book recommendation system**. Users can discover books based on **semantic search, sentiment analysis, and text classification.**

## 🛠️ Components of Project
The project is structured into five key parts:

1️⃣ **Text Data Cleaning** 🧹
   - Preprocessing and cleaning the book data.
   - Code in: `data-exploration.ipynb`

2️⃣ **Semantic Search & Vector Database** 🔍📖
   - Implementing **vector-based search** to find books matching a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
   - Code in: `vector-search.ipynb`

3️⃣ **Text Classification** 🏷️
   - Classifying books as **"fiction"** or **"non-fiction"** to enable filtering.
   - Code in: `text-classification.ipynb`

4️⃣ **Sentiment Analysis & Emotion Extraction** 😃😢😱
   - Sorting books based on their emotional tone (e.g., suspenseful, joyful, sad).
   - Code in: `sentiment-analysis.ipynb`

5️⃣ **Interactive Web App with Gradio** 🎨
   - Deploying a simple **Gradio-based UI** for users to get book recommendations.
   - Code in: `gradio-dashboard.py`
